## Overview

Most prompt engineering is manual, subjective, and time-consuming. This one isn't.

The Prompt Optimization Engine automates the entire prompt improvement workflow using genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning. You provide a base prompt — it generates dozens of variations, scores each on clarity and specificity, selects the best performers, and iteratively refines them. The result is a provably better prompt, backed by measurable scores.

No guesswork. No endless tweaking. Just better prompts, automatically.

## How It Works

```
User inputs base prompt
      │
      ▼
[Prompt Analyzer]   ──  Word count, sentence structure, weak points identified
      │
      ▼
[Variation Engine]  ──  Multiple strategies applied:
                        • Evolutionary: mutation + crossover
                        • Reinforcement: guided rewrites
                        • Hybrid: combination of both
      │
      ▼
[Multi-Metric Scorer] ──  Each variation scored on:
                          • Clarity (readability, structure, role framing)
                          • Specificity (examples, constraints, format)
                          • Overall composite score
      │
      ▼
[Fitness Selection]  ──  Best variations selected for next generation
      │
      ▼
[Groq LLM]          ──  Optional AI-powered prompt improvement
      │
      ▼
[Final Result]      ──  Optimized prompt + improvement metrics
```
